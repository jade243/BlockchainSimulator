\chapter{Explanations about the revenues} \label{appendixRevenue}

In the chapter about selfish mining, we've calculated the revenues of the honest and selfish miners. \newline

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering

  \begin{tabular}{c}
    $r\_honest =  p_0 . (1 - \alpha) . 1 + p_{0'} . \gamma . (1 - \alpha) . 1 + p_{0'} . (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) . 2$ \\
    \\
    $r\_selfish =  p_{0'} . \gamma . (1 - \alpha) . 1 + p_{0'} . \alpha . 2 + p_2 . (1 - \alpha) . 2 + P[i > 2] . (1 - \alpha) . 1$
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Revenue won by the honest and selfish miners according to $\alpha$ and $\gamma$}
\end{table}

Here are more explanations about these formulas: \newline

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    $p_0 . (1 - \alpha) . 1$ & The honest miners find a block on the actual chain, they win 1 reward.\\
    \\
    $p_{0'} . \gamma . (1 - \alpha) . 1$ & \makecell[l]{The selfish and honest miners broadcast a block at the same time, then the honest \\ miners find the next block after the selfish miners' one, the honest and selfish\\ miners win both 1 reward.}\\
    \\
    $p_{0'} . (1 - \gamma) (1 - \alpha) . 2$ & \makecell[l]{The selfish and honest miners broadcast a block at the same time, then the honest\\ miners find the next block after their own one, so they win 2 rewards.}\\
  \end{tabular}

  \begin{tabular}{l|l}
    $p_{0'} . \gamma . (1 - \alpha) . 1$ & \makecell[l]{The selfish and honest miners broadcast a block at the same time, then the honest \\ miners find the next block after the selfish miners' one, the honest and selfish \\ miners win both 1 reward.}\\
    \\
    $p_{0'} . \alpha . 2$ & \makecell[l]{The selfish and honest miners have both found a block, but the selfish miners find \\ their next block first, they publish both blocks and they win 2 rewards.}\\
    \\
    $p_2 . (1 - \alpha) . 2$ & \makecell[l]{The selfish miners had a lead of two blocks but the honest miners find one, so the \\ selfish miners publish their two blocks and they win 2 rewards.}\\
    \\
    $P[i > 2] . (1 - \alpha) . 1$ & Each time the selfish miners increase their lead above 2 blocks, they win 1 reward.\\
  \end{tabular}
