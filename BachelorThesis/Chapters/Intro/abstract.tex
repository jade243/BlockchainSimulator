\section{Abstract}

A blockchain is a list of blocks linked together using cryptography. Each block holds a list of transactions and the previous block's hash.

The first idea of the blockchain came from 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta but it was really used the first time by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve its most famous application, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. \newline

The main advantage of blockchain is the decentralization, it means there is no need of a third party to validate transactions while keeping essential properties as integrity, durability, reliability and longevity. \newline

To ensure security, blockchain rests on cryptography methods like public-key based signatures to protect transactions and hash functions for the mining process, which is the way to add a block in the blockchain.

The main goal of this work is, first, to understand how mining works by simulating a blockchain. Then, we'll analyze the weaknesses and possible attacks on mining.
