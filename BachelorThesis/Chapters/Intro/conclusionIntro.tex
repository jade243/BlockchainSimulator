\section{Uses in the world}

Now that we've understood the principles of blockchains, we may wonder who and what for people use blockchains nowadays.

\paragraph{Why people use blockchains instead of other security methods?}

We can suggest a few reasons to answer this question (see \cite{blockchainPros}) :

\begin{itemize}
  \item Blockchains are fast, secure and transparent. Moreover, history has proven its robustness since no attacks were resulting from a weakness inside the blockchain itself.
  \item In general, people have a great opinion of it: 84\% think it's provided more security than other methods.
  \item There is around 70\% cost savings on business operation and 30 - 50 \% on compliance.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{What for people use blockchains?}

In the few last years, we've seen a lot of new blockchains being launched in different fields. We can have a look at some of them (see \cite{usesBlockchain})\newline

We see that blockchains are used by governments for taxation and border controls, in the energy field and social field for insurance and healthcare for example.
